<h3>About Sefaria:</h3>
  <p>The Sefaria Project is building a free living library of Jewish texts and their interconnections, in Hebrew and in translation. Our scope is Torah in the broadest sense, from Tanakh to Talmud to Zohar to modern texts and all the volumes of commentary in between. Sefaria is created, edited, and annotated by an open community. Having digital texts enables us to create new, interactive interfaces for the Web, tablet and mobile which allow students and scholars around the world to freely learn and explore the interconnections among Torah texts. Judaism's core texts grew out of millennia-long conversations and arguments across generations. We envision creating an open space for ancient conversations to continue in new ways, with new participants, new questions, and new layers of dialogue.</p>
